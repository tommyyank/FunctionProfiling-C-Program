# FunctionProfiling-C-Program
<h2>Description</h2>

- <b>This is an assigment where I had to write a c program that uses function instrumentation to profile functions from other programs. In the file "stack.c" information is gathered about each function's execution time and stack frame. It then takes this information and writes it to a binary file. The file "stackviz.c" reads from the binary file and stores the information so it can be displayed to the user. </b>
